# AsanaTicketingSystem

## Overview
The Asana Ticketing System is designed to streamline internal request handling across our organization, ensuring structured, trackable, and timely resolution of all incoming requests. The system currently supports two major request categories:

- **Operations Requests/Issues**
- **Evaluation & IT Requests**

## Why We Built It
Prior to this system, most internal and partner support requests were managed through email, which led to common challenges like:

- Lost or missed emails
- Unclear ownership of requests
- No visibility into progress or resolution

To address these issues and improve communication and accountability, we built a lightweight ticketing workflow in Asana using forms, automations, and tags.

## How It Works
1. **Submit a Request** using the appropriate Asana form.
2. The request is automatically routed to the right person based on type and priority.
3. Updates are shared via Asana comments and email notifications.
4. Once resolved, the request is marked complete and a short **Solution Note** is shared with the requester.
